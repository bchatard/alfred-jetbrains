## Requirements

You need [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org) and [Alfred 5.0+](https://www.alfredapp.com) with the paid [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) upgrade.

This workflow need one of JetBrains products (**2019.1+**), and its [shell script](#init-shell-script) to works

## About issues

It's my daily tool, so I will fix issue that I can reproduce with **my environment**, which is
* macOS 13.3
* Alfred 5 (latest available)
* at least Node 14, but not really important, node is only required to install this workflow

Please check the [troubleshooting guide](doc/troubleshooting.md) first, and other issues.
And please follow the issue template for bug report üôè

## Customisation

- [Change Product Edition](doc/customisation/edition.md)
- [Change `bin` name](doc/customisation/bin.md)

Some of JetBrains product are available in different editions (ex: PyCharm - Professional, Edu & Community).
In that case they share the same `bin` / `keyword`, so you need to customise the _Preferences_ folder to retrieve your projects.

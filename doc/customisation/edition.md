# Customise product Edition

JetBrains deliver different edition for some products. This workflow works with a default edition for this case:

- for PyCharm, it's the Community Edition
- for IntelliJIdea, it's the Community Edition
- for CLion, it's the "Standard"

If you work with a different edition you need to customise this workflow.

### How-to

Open workflow configuration

# Customise product Edition

JetBrains deliver different edition for some products (actually PyCharm and IntelliJIdea). This workflow works with a default edition for this case:

- for PyCharm, it's the Community Edition
- for IntelliJIdea, it's the Community Edition

If you work with a different edition you need to customise this workflow.

### How-to

Open workflow configuration

Then select the appropriate edition for the product
